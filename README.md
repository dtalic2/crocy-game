# Crocy Clash

Arcade-style crocodile growth game. Move around the lagoon, eat smaller crocs and pellets, and grow huge. All vanilla HTML/CSS/JS—drop it on GitHub Pages and it runs.

## Playing locally

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (no build step needed).
2. Use `WASD` or arrow keys to move.
3. Eat lower-level crocs and pellets to increase your level. Bigger crocs end your run on contact.
4. Click **Start / Restart** to begin a new round.

## GitHub Pages

Push this repo to GitHub, then enable GitHub Pages with the `main` branch and the root directory. Your page will be served at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Notes

- The game is fully client-side; no backend or assets are required beyond the included files.
- Crocs and pellets respawn to keep the lagoon busy. Levels are shown on every crocodile.
